### 2.1 Working With Interpolations

* v-once =>  allows you to render the text in its original state, even if the data changes. 
  * in our example try change name & check what will happen in nothing 
* {{  }} => mustache syntax that we used to display variable from our data
* v-html => for binding html .. when you write any thing will be converted 
   * Notes : it's dangerous cause of technically, somebody can type in some malicious code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2 Binding attributes with v-bind
 *  In Vue.js, you bind attributes using the v-bind directives.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ### 2.3 Using computed properties
  * Methods
   * we mentioned before that more than difference between methods & computed property in tutorial1
     * so, let's check ch2 lesson4
      * in this lesson we do the same thing one of them using computed & another with method .. every time you type to call function that calculate time case computed time only will calculate for first time only cause of right here is not a reactive method
      . but , method every time will you type any thing will calculate time .. -- this example not releated with caching --
